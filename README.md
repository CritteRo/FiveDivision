# FiveDivision
A FiveM gamemode inspired by Tom Clancy's The Division

## IMPORTANT!
I will **not** help you with this code. It's not completed. It will have some dependencies that you will need. Code might not be pretty, or might not be what you need.

## About:
FiveDivision is meant to be a gamemode designed around Tom Clancy's The Division's gameplay-loop. Players can cooperate by completing missions, either solo or in a group, or working towards completing community goals, OR they can compete in organized PvP arenas, open-world combat, or PvPvE challenges.

## Story:
A climate anomaly sends the county of San Andreas in a deep winter, leaving the state first without basic utilities, then without [law and order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP3MuUTmXNk). Soon, factions form around the city, as food rations become scarce.

A joint FIB-IAA task force, known as "The Division" is started, with the intent purpose of securing LS, and protecting civilians.

## Gameplay Loop:
### Solo & Group play:
* Players can organize in groups. Group leader will always be the player that starts missions or cancels them. Every group member should be able to advance / continue gameplay events during a mission.
* Difficulty should be increased, depending on group members. Increasing difficulty the more members you have, but also increasing rewards.
* Groups should not have friendly-fire activated.

### Missions:
* 3 types of missions: Main missions, side missions and open-world missions.
* Main missions should be big missions, relevant to the main story, and with potential impact to the open-world.
* Side missions should be smaller than main missions, but still significant to the story.
* Open-world missions would be random events, spawning in the open-world.

### Community Goals:
* Community goals would be large scale challenges.
* Every player can participate in mission completions, killing specific faction members, etc.

### Arena:
* PvP 1vs1 arena. Players can queue for arena matchmaking, or challenge or players directly.

### Open-world PvP:
* Certain areas of LS are not accessible to the Division network. Friendly-fire is activated here. 

### Player stats:
* Money. Money is still being used inside LS. It's mostly used to buy armor, ammo and some cosmetics.
