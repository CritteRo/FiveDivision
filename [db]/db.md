# Databases

Every resource should create the tables that they need to use:

Current table names used:
* `users`
* `outpost_rewards`
* `challenges`
* `challenge_users`

Please, MAKE SURE you do not have these tables in your DB, or else it will cause problems!!

You should use a clean table with this gamemode.
